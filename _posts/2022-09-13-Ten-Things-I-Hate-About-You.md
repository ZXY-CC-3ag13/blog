**Mr. Morgan** : All right... I assume everyone's found time to complete their poem... except... for Mr. Donner.

*[starts laughing]* 

**Mr. Morgan** : Who has an excuse

*[laughs even harder, then stops]*

**Mr. Morgan** : . Shaft! Lose the glasses.

*[Joey removes his sunglasses, revealing his bruised nose from his earlier confrontation with Bianca]*

**Mr. Morgan** : All right... anyone brave enough to read theirs aloud?

*[Everyone looks at each other, waiting to see who goes first, Kat finally raises her hand]* 

**Kat Stratford** : I will.

**Mr. Morgan** : *[rolls his eyes and sighs]*  Lord, here we go.

**Kat Stratford** : I hate the way you talk to me, and the way you cut your hair. I hate the way you drive my car. I hate it when you stare. I hate your big dumb combat boots, and the way you read my mind. I hate you so much it makes me sick; it even makes me rhyme.

*[sighs]*

**Kat Stratford** : I hate it, I hate the way you're always right. I hate it when you lie. I hate it when you make me laugh, even worse when you make me cry.

*[Kat's voice breaks and she looks at Patrick]* 

**Kat Stratford** : I hate it when you're not around, and the fact that you didn't call.

*[starts to cry]* 

**Kat Stratford** : But mostly I hate the way I don't hate you. Not even close, not even a little bit, not even at all.

*[Kat walks out the classroom]*
